# Cpp-samples
working through school samples for feedback on specific issues

Note: Some conventions used in the programs were at the request of the professor (system("pause"))*
Using C-Strings instead of Strings or Arrays instead of Vectors, etc.

The first version of each project is as was turned in for the assignment. Several I have revisited
to add better comments or to fix problems. Feel free to leave comments or give suggestions. 

*This is likely due to debugging methods using Visual Studio.
