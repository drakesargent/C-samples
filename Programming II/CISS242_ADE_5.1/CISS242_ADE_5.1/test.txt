I, Kenneth Drake-Sargent,
am writing a program today that will need a good deal of
testing. I really hope that it will work on the first time
this thing is run, however I don't hold out hope because a
program does not abide. Then I will take pains to figure
out what really went wrong.
I
hope
it
works
properly,
but
who
really
knows.
